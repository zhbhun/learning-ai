- [mistral-finetune](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-finetune) - mistral-finetune is a light-weight codebase that enables memory-efficient and performant finetuning of Mistral's models. It is based on LoRA, a training paradigm where most weights are frozen and only 1-2% of additional weights in the form of low-rank matrix perturbations are trained.
