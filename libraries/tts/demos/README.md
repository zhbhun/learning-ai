When Little Red Riding Hood entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him. "Good day to you, Little Red Riding Hood." - "Thank you, wolf." - "Where are you going so early, Little Red Riding Hood?" - "To grandmother's." - "And what are you carrying under your apron?" - "Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength.”

At last, the eggs began to crack. One yellow duckling stepped out of its shell, then another. They all shook their wings. “Quack, quack!” Look at all of you!” cried Mama Duck with joy. “You are so cute!” “Quack, quack, quack!” they said. “Come line up," said Mama Duck. "We will go down to the lake for your very first swim.” She counted – one, two, three, four, five. “Oh dear!” she said with a frown. “I should have six ducklings!”

小红帽刚走进森林就碰到了一条狼。 小红帽不知道狼是坏家伙，所以一点也不怕它。
"你好，小红帽，"狼说。
"谢谢你，狼先生。"
"小红帽，这么早要到哪里去呀？"
"我要到奶奶家去。"
"你那围裙下面有什么呀？"
"蛋糕和葡萄酒。昨天我们家烤了一些蛋糕，可怜的奶奶生了病，要吃一些好东西才能恢复过来。"
